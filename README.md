# WasmEdge Tools for Tensorflow Extension

The [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge) is a high performance WebAssembly runtime optimized for server side applications. This project provides WasmEdge tools accessing with [Tensorflow C library](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c).

## Getting Started

### Install the WasmEdge-Tensorflow-Tools and dependencies

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- -e all -v 0.11.2-alpha.1
```

### Example

We provide a simple tool for showing the tensors information of TensorFlow-Lite models.
Take the [bird v1 tflite model](https://github.com/second-state/wasm-learning/blob/master/rust/birds_v1/lite-model_aiy_vision_classifier_birds_V1_3.tflite) for example.

```bash
./show-tflite-tensor lite-model_aiy_vision_classifier_birds_V1_3.tflite
```

The output will be as following:

```bash
Input tensor nums: 1
    Input tensor name: module/hub_input/images_uint8
        dimensions: [1 , 224 , 224 , 3]
        data type: UInt8
        tensor byte size: 150528
Output tensor nums: 1
    Output tensor name: module/prediction
        dimensions: [1 , 965]
        data type: UInt8
        tensor byte size: 965
```

## Build

### Get Source Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-tensorflow-tools.git
cd WasmEdge-tensorflow-tools
git checkout 0.11.2-alpha.1
```

### Check Dependencies

WasmEdge will try to use the latest LLVM release to create our nightly build.
If you want to build from source, you may need to install these dependencies by yourself or using our docker images which provides several Linux distribution support.

- GCC 11.1.0 (>= 9.4.0)

### Prepare the Environment

#### Option 1: Use Docker Images

Repository on dockerhub `wasmedge/wasmedge`

You can use the following commands to get our latest docker image:

```bash
docker pull wasmedge/wasmedge # Equals to wasmedge/wasmedge:latest
```

The followings are available tags of docker images to build and run `WasmEdge-Tensorflow-Tools`:

| tag name                | arch    | based operating system | LLVM version | ENVs                  | compatibility            | comments                                                                            |

| `manylinux2014_x86_64`  | x86\_64 | CentOS 7, 7.9.2009     | 12.0.0       | CC=gcc, CXX=g++       | Ubuntu 16.04+, CentOS 7+ | This is for developers who familiar with CentOS on x86\_64 architecture             |

#### Option 2: Install dependencies on Ubuntu 20.04 manually

```bash
# Tools and libraries
sudo apt install -y \
    software-properties-common \
    cmake \
    libboost-all-dev

# WasmEdge supports both clang++ and g++ compilers
# You can choose one of them for building this project
# If you prefer GCC
sudo apt install -y gcc g++
# Else you can choose clang
sudo apt install -y clang-12
```

### Build WasmEdge-Tensorflow-Tools

`WasmEdge-Tensorflow-Tools` depends on `WasmEdge-core`, `WasmEdge-image`, and `WasmEdge-tensorflow`.
You have to prepare the `WasmEdge-core`, `WasmEdge-image`, and the `WasmEdge-tensorflow` before you build `WasmEdge-Tensorflow-Tools`.
We provides two options for setting up the `WasmEdge-core`:

#### Create and Enter the Build Folder

```bash
# After pulling our WasmEdge docker image
docker run -it --rm \
    -v <path/to/your/WasmEdge-tensorflow/source/folder>:/root/WasmEdge-tensorflow-tools \
    wasmedge/wasmedge:latest
# In docker
cd /root/WasmEdge-tensorflow-tools
mkdir -p build && cd build
```

#### Option 1. Use built-in CMakeLists to get WasmEdge-Core, WasmEdge-image, and WasmEdge-tensorflow (Recommended)

```bash
# In docker
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make
```

#### Option 2. Use specific version of WasmEdge-Core by giving WASMEDGE_CORE_PATH

You can also specify the `WasmEdge-image` by assigning `WASMEDGE_IMAGE_PATH`, and the `WasmEdge-tensorflow` by assigning `WASMEDGE_TENSORFLOW_PATH`. The dependencies not assigned will be fetched with the default versions automatically.

```bash
# In docker
cmake \
    -DWASMEDGE_CORE_PATH=<path/to/WasmEdge/source> \
    -DWASMEDGE_IMAGE_PATH=<path/to/WasmEdge-image/source> \
    -DWASMEDGE_TENSORFLOW_PATH=<path/to/WasmEdge-tensorflow/source> \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make
```

The executable `build/tools/wasmedge-tensorflow` is the runner for executing WASM or compiled WASM.
The executable `build/tools/wasmedge-tensorflow-lite` is the runner for executing WASM or compiled WASM with only TensorFlow-lite host functions supported.
